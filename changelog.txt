    Intial Public Release
  
  2004-04-20

    with separate SELECT and DELETE queries to make
    the script compatible with MySQL 3.23 and other databases
    
    Modified edit_survey_edit_answer_type template to
    include a count of all questions using the requested
    answer type. If the answer type is being used, a warning
    is shown detailing how changes will affect already supplied
    results of the survey. The answer type cannot be deleted
    if it is in use within the survey.
    
    Fixed bug that caused image selections to be reset when
    new answer values were added to answer type.

Version 0.95.6

  2004-01-13
  
    Modified results page to look for "_left" and "_right"
    image in bar graphs (to allow for "rounded images"). 
    For example, an image setting of "bar.gif" will look for
    "bar_left.gif" and "bar_right.gif" and if they exist,
    put them on the left and/or right of the stretched bar
    graph image. 
  
  2004-01-12
  
    DB: Changed answer_values.color to answer_values.image
        VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '' column
        
    Modified answer values to list images from the
    template image directory as possible bar graph
    images. Any file matching the "image_extensions"
    configuration setting is listed in a dropdown.
    
    Modified results page to use new, full image name
    and grab height from the image (so it does not 
    change). 
    
Version 0.95.5

  2004-01-09

    The following bug fixes deal with cleaning up
    the moving of answer types and values under
    a specific survey instead of being global. 

    Fixed multiple bugs dealing with copying an
    existing survey. All questions, dependencies,
    and answer types and values are now copied
    from the old survey to the new one.

    Fixed bug that did not properly display
    dependent question numbers when editing a question

    Modified Delete Survey actions to also delete
    answer types and values associated with the

    DB: Added "sid" INT column to answer_types table

    Moved adding and editing of answers and values
    under the "edit survey" page and permissions. 

    Answers and answer values are now related
    to a specific survey instead of being global.
    This change was made so that each survey can have
    it's own "yes/no" question and modify it without
    modifying the answer type or value for every
    other survey.

Version 0.95.4

    Demographics will now be added as regular 
    MM or MS questions with the appropriate

    have dependencies.

    the dependencies of the questions. Also
    added checks so that page breaks cannot
    be deleted when they'll break dependencies.
    
    Fixed Bug #4, the answer value of 0 (zero)
    is now accepted.
    
    Fixed Bug #5, unchecked demographics
    are now deleted correctly when chosen
    to do so from the Edit Demographics
    page. Added multi-table DELETE query
    that is only compatible with MySQL 4.0.0+
  
    Added text filter to INI file. This is a
    comma separated list of words that will
    not be saved as answers if they are given
    as the sole text in text boxes. For example,
    answers such as "no" "n/a" and "none" will
    not be saved (for text answers) since they 
    don't contribute anything to the results. 
    
  2003-11-03

    Edit Answer page.

    demographic selections when coming back to
    them.
    
    Added feature to Hide or Require a question
    based upon answers to previous questions. 
    Page break is automatically added if previous
    question is on same page. (Moving questions up
    or down or removing page breaks may break
    dependencies at this time.)
    
  2003-10-27

    start on page 2. Moved storage of demographic
    results to Results table. 
    
    DB: Deleted Demographics and Results_dg tables.
    
    Added get_answer_values() method to survey class
    to retrieve different answer values for a specific
    answer ID (aid). Function will run a query to retrieve
    values for the aid and store result in static array.
    Subsequent requests for the answer values will come
    from the array and will not trigger a query.

Version 0.95.1

    Fixed bug that did not correctly copy first question after 
    page breaks when creating new survey and copying existing 
    survey
    
    Fixed bug that did not correctly move questions up in the 
    question list

Version 0.95

  2003-05-01:

    clear when empty filter form was submitted

    Changed name of survey2.inc to survey.sql.inc

    Added "Quit" survey button to final question page of survey

    Changed Entire "add survey" process. The initial create page will
    create a survey with default values and then redirect to the edit
    page for the survey. This stops what is basically a "duplicating"
    of code, one for creation and one for editing. The only drawback
    to this change is that more "blank" surveys could be created as
    people create surveys but do not add questions to them.

    Fixed bug that did not create page breaks correctly when creating
    new surveys by copying another

    Fixed template error that created incorrect link to "Return to
    Main" after completing or quitting a survey

    Added ability to move questions up and down in the survey from the
    edit page

    Survey System tested in alternate browsers including Netscape,
    Opera, Mozilla, and Lynx with no display problems except for one.
    Lynx will choose the first option of a radio button group as
    the default, even though no option was checked. This could lead
    to skewed results if people accept the "default" answer instead
    of taking the time to choose their own. All other browsers tested
    leave all radio buttons unchecked when loading the page.
