        + Allow relative paths in "Completion Redirect Page URL" (working on)

        + Enable save/continue/edit feature controlled by admin option:

          ( ) Allow users to continue/edit any saved/completed survey (choose which by date/time stamp)

        + Ability to hide the question list or just show last entered question when creating survey questions

        + Set minimum time to complete surveys so that Admin can exclude these from results (optionally)

        + Password encryption/hash controlled by a configuration setting

        + Send custom email upon completion of survey (either to designated address,
          user who completed survey (requires email address in access control or email question),
          or both)

    2. Regarding Survey Results:
        + (bug?) Changing answer type from text to MM/MS results in no results showing up (working on)

        + Add custom reports feature to include custom result layouts (working on)
          * Average
          * Numeric total
          * Crosstab
          * etc.

        + Filter based on text fields (matching search, for example)

        + Add ability to list text answers from newest -> latest
          and latest -> newest.

        + Add more graphical representations of the answers
          to questions, such as pie graph, etc

    3. Regarding questions/answers:
        + (bug?) Are lookbacks copied when new surveys are created? (working on)

        + Add alternate input types (working on)
          * Date w/range

          * Email

        + Add ability to add questions to blocks/groups along with:
          * assign dependencies per block
          * ability to randomize question order per block
          * display only a set number of questions out of total in block
            (have bank of twenty questions and randomly choose 5)
          * allow nested blocks
          * ability to treat questions within block as "one question"
            (example: could ask one question with language oriented towards children with answer
            values of boy/girl and another question oriented towards adults with answer values
            of male/female and have results be counted towards the same question)
          * ability to enforce unique answers per block
            (example: have 5 questions where user must rate something from 1 - 5 and enforce
            that within the block, each number is only chosen once)

        + Add ability to randomize answer values on a per question basis

        + Add ability to include "other" block on a per question basis

        + Add ability to include dropdown/text type answers in a matrix layout

        + Ability to create dependencies based upon whether text field was empty or not

        + Ability to import question/answer set from other surveys

        + Incorporate features that'll make a "test engine"
          * Flag answer value(s) as "correct"
          * Assign weight to questions and answers
          * Show grade/score on Access Control page
          * Admin option to show correct answer or not

        + Match S or T answer types to regular expression (advanced)

    4. Regarding taking Surveys:
        + Remove "previous page" from first page of surveys (working on)

        + Print version of survey (but how to handle dependencies?)

        + Ability to choose between "page x of y" or "%x complete" (or provide the relevant variables
          (so users can adjust the templates)

        + Add JavaScript elapsed time clock to surveys with time limit

        + Add "notice" label when taking a survey as Admin (because access-controls are
          bypassed and completed-surveys are not incremented)

    5. PHP related:
        + Add language file and move any strings there (working on)

        + Move any magic numbers/strings to constants (working on)

        + Detect ability to create subdirectories (regarding Smarty) upon installation
          and dynamically set $use_sub_dirs to FALSE is unable

        + (Full) Support for alternate databases

        + Fix concurrency issues. If a lot of people move questions
          around in the same survey at the same time, it could
          cause trouble.

        + Include the (optional) use an an SMTP mailer class that'll handle authentication
          for those users who require it
